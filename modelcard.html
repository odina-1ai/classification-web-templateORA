              <!-- new model card code here -->
              <p>
                Meant to be used as an educational tool for users to determine whether flowers are posionous or not. 
                Current limitations:<br> 
                Flowers can be both posionous and edible, depending on dosage or certain parts of flowers can be poisonous 
                and other parts are not.<br>
                The image classification model is most accurate when flower are close and central in the image.
